## 100 Days of Swift - Milestone Challenge Day 74

This is the milestone project for Day 74.  Basically I am creating a simple Apple Notes like app.

The class 100 Days of Swift can be found at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

The basic approach here is to use notifications to handle deletions and save, while correctly handling the keyboard positioning on some devices.  I am also allowing the user to send a copy of the note via the sharesheet.
